  <h2><a name="A1">Description</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A1">PDF2Parts is a free, open source set of utilities for
  extracting text, images, URLs, metadata, and individual pages from
  files in Portable Document Format (PDF). The executable,
  pdf2parts.exe, runs as a 32-bit, console-mode process under Windows.
  The similarly named library and configuration files, pdf2parts.dll,
  pdf2parts.tlb, and pdf2parts.ini, are also needed by the program.
  Other utilities in the distribution extract particular kinds of parts
  in case only they are needed: pdf2metadata.exe, pdf2pages.exe,
  pdf2images.exe, pdf2graphics.exe, pdf2text.exe, and
  pdf2urls.exe.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="A2">Installation</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A2">Unzip the distribution archive, pdf2parts.zip, into
  its own directory, e.g., to<br>
  C:\PDF2Parts</a></p>

  <p>Run one of the executables either by referencing its full path or
  by adding the installation directory to the Windows search path.</p>

  <h2><a name="A3">Operation</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A3">Pass the PDF to be analyzed as a command-line
  parameter to the executable, e.g.,</a></p>

  <p>pdf2parts.exe Test.pdf</p>

  <p>or</p>

  <p>pdf2parts.exe &quot;C:\Temp Files\Test.pdf&quot;</p>

  <p>Note that the file parameter should b quoted if it contains a
  space character. Two optional command-line parameters specify the
  Dots Per Inch (DPI) and format of image files. The default values are
  150 for DPI and TIFF for format. The DPI number can range from about
  72 to 300. Possible formats are BMP, EMF, EMF+, EPS, GIF, JPG, PNG,
  TIFF, and WMF (capitalization does not matter). For example, to
  produce a a 300 DPI PNG image of each PDF page, the syntax could
  be<br>
  pdf2parts.exe test.pdf 300 png</p>

  <p>Two types of image files are produced. An image is created for
  each PDF page as a whole. In addition, any graphics embedded within
  the page are extracted. For clarity, these will be called page images
  and embedded graphics.</p>

  <p>When run, the program prints to the console how many pages are in
  the PDF, and how many graphics are in each page. Several files
  containing various parts of the PDF are produced. First, a text file
  is saved with metadata about the PDF, such as the author, security
  settings, and whether it is image-only or tagged for accessibility.
  Then, for each page, an individual PDF, an image, a text file, and
  embedded graphics are saved. Last, a text file with all text is
  saved.</p>

  <p>That text version of the PDF has the same file name except for a
  .txt extension, e.g.,<br>
  Test.pdf</p>

  <p>becomes<br>
  Test.txt</p>

  <p>The text file containing settings of meta data is given
  &quot;_meta&quot; as a suffix, e.g.,<br>
  Test_meta.txt</p>

  <p>Similarly, the list of URLs extracted is contained in<br>
  test_urls.txt</p>

  <p>Other output files have a numeric suffix before the file
  extension. The suffix begins with an underline character, followed by
  the page number. The page number is right justified with leading 0s
  so that file names sort properly in a directory listing.</p>

  <p>Thus, the text version of page 1 would be<br>
  Test_01.txt</p>

  <p>The PDF version would be<br>
  test_01.pdf</p>

  <p>and the image version would be<br>
  Test_01.tif</p>

  <p>Any graphics embedded in the page are saved to separate files with
  a longer suffix that includes the sequential number of the image on
  the page. A dash precedes the image number. For example, if the
  second graphic on page 1 is in BMP format, its corresponding file
  would be<br>
  Test_01-2.bmp</p>

  <p>Each utility may be run without command-line parameters to be
  reminded of its syntax. The Batch file RunMulti.bat enables a utility
  to be run against multiple PDF files meeting a wildcard
  specification. The first parameter is the utility name and the second
  parameter is the wildcard specification, e.g.,<br>
  RunMulti pdf2text C:\temp\*.pdf<br>
  (Note that pdf2text.exe only creates a text version of the whole PDF
  whereas pdf2parts.exe also creates one for each individual page.)</p>

  <h2><a name="A4">Change Log</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A4">Beta 0.9 on January 27, 2012<br>
  Initial public beta.</a></p>

  <p>Beta 0.95 on January 29, 2012<br>
  Changed program name from PDF2Images to PDF2Parts, since text files
  are now also produced as output. There are a text file with metadata,
  a text file for each page, and a text file with all text. In addition
  to an image file produced for each component image of a page, an
  image file is also produced for the page as a whole.</p>

  <p>Beta 0.98 on February 3, 2012<br>
  Used a registration-free COM technique rather than calling a Win32
  DLL in order to avoid memory errors when extracting text from PDFs
  that are not small in size.</p>

  <p>Version 1.0 on November 3, 2015<br>
  Added Tagged status to PDF metadata. Added pdf2urls.exe utility.
  Added RunMulti batch file. Uploaded project as a GitHub repository
  at<br>
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/JamalMazrui/pdf2parts">https://github.com/JamalMazrui/pdf2parts</a></p>

  <p>Version 1.1 on November 4, 2015<br>
  Obtained Tagged status via the QuickPDF library, thereby eliminating
  need for external pdfinfo.exe utility. Revised pdf2text.exe so that
  only a text file of the whole PDF is created. Thus RunMulti.bat can
  generate a text file for each PDF matching a wildcard specification,
  e.g., those in a directory.</p>

  <p>Note that these are commercial products needed to successfully
  compile new versions of the executables. Their source code, however,
  is open and free to share according to the GNU Lesser General Public
  License (LGPL). Batch and include files needed for development of
  PDF2Parts are also contained in the distribution. The win2con.exe
  utility was used to convert each executable from a Windows to console
  mode binary.</p>

  <p>I welcome feedback, which helps PDF2PARTS improve over time. When
  reporting a problem, the more specifics, the better, including steps
  to reproduce it if possible.</p>
