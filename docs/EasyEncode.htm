  <h2><a name="A1">Description</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A1">EasyEncode is a set of free, open source command-line
  utilities for detecting and converting file encodings among common
  formats, operating under Windows. Each utility operates as a
  stand-alone executable in console mode, without a graphical user
  interface (GUI). Four encodings are supported, accounting for most
  encodings in use today: UTF-16, UTF-8 with a byte order mark (BOM),
  UTF-8 without a BOM, and ANSI.</a></p>

  <p>Character encodings are a complex subject. EasyEncode does not
  eliminate a developer&#39;s need for knowledge in this area, but once
  encodings are understood conceptually, the software eases work with
  them. The utilities may be used either manually at the command line,
  or programmatically by applications that call them as needed.</p>

  <p>EasyEncode uses abbreviated names for encodings in lower case
  without hyphens. They are further explained as follows:</p>

  <p>ansi = an encoding where each of an ordered set of 256 characters
  is represented by a single byte, having an ordinal value between 0
  and 255, inclusive. The first 128 characters, between 0 and 127, are
  the standard ASCII character set, consisting of English letters,
  numbers, punctuation symbols, and control characters. The 128
  characters in the upper half of ansi, between 128 and 255, are other
  symbols such as the copyright symbol and Greek mathematical symbols.
  The upper half of ansi varies depending on the default language of
  the computer, so is different, for example, in Russian than
  English.</p>

  <p>utf16 = a multibyte encoding for the Unicode character set, which
  is a standard ordering of over a million characters, representing
  virtually every natural and specialized language in the world. The
  first 128 characters of Unicode are the same as ASCII. utf16 is an
  encoding that generally uses two bytes to represent each Unicode
  character, though more bytes may be used.</p>

  <p>utf8b = a different encoding for the same Unicode character set.
  The first 128 characters of utf8 are the same single-byte
  representations as ASCII. Characters with higher ordinal values
  require two or three bytes to be encoded. There are two versions of
  utf8: utf8b and utf8n. A byte order mark (BOM) is a sequence of a few
  bytes at the beginning of a file which serves as a signature
  indicating the encoding of characters in the rest of the file. utf8b
  uses a BOM, whereas utf8n does not. Besides an initial BOM, a utf8b
  and utf8n represent file content identically.</p>

  <p>utf8n = UTF8 encoding without a BOM, as explained above. This has
  become the default encoding on the Linux and Mac operating systems.
  In Windows, there is no single, default encoding. The console mode
  environment uses ansi by default; API and COM calls typically use
  utf16; XML and other files often use utf8b. Since there is no single
  default, Microsoft recommends the explicit use of a BOM with either
  utf16 or utf8. For utf16, a BOM is required, whereas for utf8, it is
  optional. Thus utf8 encoding on Windows generally includes a BOM
  whereas on other platforms, it does not. Increasingly, software on
  other platforms ignores a BOM, but some common applications till are
  confused by a BOM, since these initial bytes of a file do not
  represent valid Unicode characters, themselves.</p>

  <h2><a name="A2">Operation</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A2">The syntax is the same for the five EasyEncode
  utilities: enc.exe, utf16.exe, utf8b.exe, utf8n.exe, and
  ansi.exe:</a></p>

  <p>util.exe FilePath</p>

  <p>where util.exe is one of the above executables and FilePath is a
  sufficient path and name of the file to process. Each utility has a
  single purpose indicated by its file name:</p>

  <p>enc.exe = detect and report the encoding of the file.</p>

  <p>utf16.exe = convert file to utf16 encoding. Doing this involves
  detecting the current encoding first, so that characters are properly
  recognized before being mapped to a different encoding. No conversion
  is attempted if the current encoding fails to be detected, or if it
  is detected to be the same as the desired encoding.</p>

  <p>utf8b.exe = convert file to utf8b encoding.</p>

  <p>utf8n.exe = convert file to utf8n encoding. This might be used,
  for example, to prepare a file for a cross-platform application that
  expects utf8n encoding of all input.</p>

  <p>ansi.exe = convert file to ansi encoding. Note that this may lose
  characters that are not represented in the 256-character set of
  ansi.</p>

  <p>In addition to the 32-bit executables mentioned above, EasyEncode
  now includes 64-bit versions with the same file names except for a
  &quot;64&quot; suffix after the root name of each file, i.e.,
  ansi64.exe, enc64.exe, utf1664.exe, utf8b64.exe, and utf8n64.exe.</p>

  <p>In the conversion utilities, the original file is replaced if the
  desired encoding is different from the current one, which must be
  detectable. The automatic detection is extremely accurate, but not
  perfect. In rare cases, the actual encoding of a file may not be
  properly detected.</p>

  <p>When a path contains a space character, the path should be
  enclosed in quotation marks (a standard Windows convention).</p>

  <p>Installation</p>

  <p>Unzip the archive at the web address<br>
  <a href=
  "http://EmpowermentZone.com/EasyEncode.zip">http://EmpowermentZone.com/EasyEncode.zip</a></p>

  <p>e.g., to the directory<br>
  C:\EasyEncode</p>

  <p>Then run one of the utilities, passing a file path as a
  command-line parameter. If no parameter is passed, a simple help
  message is displayed.</p>

  <p>The utilities may be run from any directory. To do so without
  specifying the full path of a utility, add the EasyEncode directory
  to the Windows search path.</p>

  <h2><a name="A4">Change Log</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A4">Version 1.1 on September 13, 2015<br>
  Recompiled the utilities with the latest version of AutoIt and added
  64-bit versions.</a></p>

  <p>Version 1.0 on November 10,2011<br>
  Official release.</p>

  <p>Version 0.9 on November 6,2011<br>
  Initial public beta.</p>

  <h2><a name="A5">Development Notes</a></h2>

  <p><a name="A5">EasyEncode is written in the AutoIT scripting
  language, available from<br></a><a href=
  "http://AutoITScript.com">http://AutoITScript.com</a></p>

  <p>commented source code is in text files with a .au3 extension.
  Batch files are included to recompile the utilities, assuming the
  default installation of the AutoIT development package.</p>

  <p>I welcome feedback, which will help EasyEncode improve over time.
  When reporting a problem, please be as specific as possible about
  Windows version and steps to reproduce the problem.</p>
